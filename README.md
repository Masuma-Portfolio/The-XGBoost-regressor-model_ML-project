# The-XGBoost-regressor-model_ML-project


Calorie Burn Prediction using Machine Learning: I have used XGBoost Regressor model, a machine learning model with a lower mean absolute error that produces more accurate outcomes utilizing these machine learning methods.
I used "Kaggle" as my dataset store. A total of 15000 instances and 7 attributes of data are present throughout 2 CSV files. The "Kaggle" repository's dataset comprises information about a variety of people, including their height, weight, gender, age, workout intensity, heart rate, and body temperature. The training data is taken from the “exercise.csv” and “calories.csv” datasets.
The XGBoost regressor algorithm was proven to be an effective and efficient method in predicting the calories burnt prediction.
